The directory tree is as follows:

Project
   |---Data
   |---KNN
   |---NaiveBayes
   |---Perceptron
   |---Winnow


The "Data" directory contains:
 - The original email messages from Enron dataset:
   Data\enron1\ham
   Data\enron1\spam
  
 - The Python script which we wrote, process.py, which creates pairs of training set & test set of feature vectors:
   Data\enron1\process.py
   
 - The pairs of training set & test set of feature vectors, along with "stats" file which describes which words were
   chosen to participate in the feature vector. There are 10 pairs per training fraction. For example for training fraction 0.1 and run #0:
   Data\enron1\test_0.1_0.txt
   Data\enron1\train_0.1_0.txt
   Data\enron1\stats_0.1_0.txt
   
Each of the other directories contains the relevant files per algorithm. The relevant files are matlab code (.m)
and graphs (.fig) generated by this code.
Each file whose name stars with "main" is an executable matlab script.
For example, the executable scripts of Winnow algorithm are:
	Winnow\main_winnow.m
	Winnow\main_winnow_test_decrease_factor.m
